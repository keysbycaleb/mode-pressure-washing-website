     <h4 class="sub-title">About Solar Panel Cleaning</h4>
     <p>Dirty solar panels can lose up to 25% of their efficiency. Dust, dirt, bird droppings, and other debris block sunlight from reaching the solar cells. Regular cleaning ensures you get the maximum power output and the best return on your investment.</p>
     <p>Using tap water from a hose can leave behind mineral deposits that can permanently etch the glass and reduce efficiency. Our professional service uses deionized water, which leaves a spot-free finish and is safer for your panels.</p>
