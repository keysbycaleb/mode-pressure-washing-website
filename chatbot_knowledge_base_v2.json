      "This JSON file contains the complete knowledge base and conversational logic for the chatbot.",
      "**CRITICAL PRE-PROCESSING STEP:** Before matching any user input against the 'intents' below, you MUST normalize the input string in your JavaScript file (`script.js`).",
      "**Normalization Steps:**",
      "1. Convert the entire user input string to lowercase (e.g., 'What Is YOUR Price?' becomes 'what is your price?').",
      "2. Remove all punctuation (periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points, etc.). For example: 'what is your price?' becomes 'what is your price'.",
      "**TYPO HANDLING / FUZZY MATCHING:**",
      "The lists below are extensive, but users will still make typos. Implement a fuzzy matching algorithm to handle them.",
      "1. After normalizing the string, compare it against the phrases in the 'intents' object.",
      "2. For typos, use an algorithm like Levenshtein distance. If a user's input has a Levenshtein distance of 1 or 2 from a phrase in the database, consider it a match (e.g., 'presure washing' matches 'pressure washing').",
      "3. If no exact or close-typo match is found, proceed with the word-matching logic described in the original prompt (find the intent with the most matching words, handle ties by asking for clarification, and use the fallback for low-confidence matches)."
